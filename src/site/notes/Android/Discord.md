### How to install
> [!tip] I recommend to use the non-rooted version even if your phone is rooted, as I had issue with the root method

1. You will need to download and install the latest release of Vendetta Manager [here](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/VendettaManager/releases)
2. Once it's done, you can launch the app and install the latest version of the Vendetta mod. It won"t be replacing your original Discord application but instead you will have a new app caled "Vendetta".
### Update
In the VendettaManager settings, you can configure how often you want to check if there's a new version of the mod available. You can also specify which branch you want to update from, either `Stable`, `Beta` or `Also`, I recommend that you stick with `Stable`
