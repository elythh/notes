## FAQ
> [!question] What is Discord ?
> Discord is a voice, video, and text chat app that's used by tens of millions of people ages 13+ to talk and hang out with their communities and friends.

> [!question] Why would I use a modified Discord client on Android ?
> You might have heard of [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) already. If not, BetterDiscord is a client mod that allows you to extend the functionality of the default Discord app by adding community made plugins and themes.

## Vendetta
> [!question] What is Vendetta ?
>  Vendetta is mod for Discord's mobile apps. Similar to client like BetterDiscord on desktop, it allows you to install plugins and custom themes.

This mod works on Android **AND** iOS.
> [!fail] Althought I know it is also available on iOS, i won't be talking about that part here because I am exclusively an Android user.

### How to install
> [!tip] I recommend to use the non-rooted version even if your phone is rooted, as I had issue with the root method

1. You will need to download and install the latest release of Vendetta Manager [here](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/VendettaManager/releases)
2. Once it's done, you can launch the app and install the latest version of the Vendetta mod. It won"t be replacing your original Discord application but instead you will have a new app caled "Vendetta".
### Update
In the VendettaManager settings, you can configure how often you want to check if there's a new version of the mod available. You can also specify which branch you want to update from, either `Stable`, `Beta` or `Also`, I recommend that you stick with `Stable`

### First step
Once you installed Vendetta, you can find plugins and themes in they official server, under the #plugins and #themes channels. To install any of them, simply long click on the thread button and click the `Install` button.

To configure your newly installed plugins, you will need to go to the Vendetta settings and then select the `Plugins` section. There you can toggle and configure your plugins.
The same things apply for the `themes`, except that you are not able to activate more than 1 theme at the same time.

### Recommended plugins
To find any of the bellow mentioned plugin, simply go to the #plugins channel in the official Vendetta Discord and search for the name of the plugin.
* NoDelete : a plugin that allows you to keep deleted messages locally, until you restart the app
* PlatformIndicator : Similar to the Desktop version, it allows you to see which platform the user is connected to (Desktop, Mobile, Web..)
* No typing : Hides your typing status from others
* Hide gift button : everything is in the name
* Mark all as read : adds a `/marksallasread` command
* HideBlockedMessage : Completely hides messages from blocked people, instead of showing a `Blocked message` message
* Hidden Channel : allows you to see the channels you aren't allowed to access
